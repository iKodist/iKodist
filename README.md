### 🙏 &nbsp;Programmer's Prayer :

<p align="center">
  
> Our program, who art in memory,<br>
called by thy name;<br>
thy operating system run;<br>
thy function be done at runtime<br>
as it was in development.<br>
Give us this day our daily output.<br>
And forgive us our code duplication,<br>
as we forgive those who<br>
duplicate code against us.<br>
And lead us not into frustration;<br>
but deliver us from GOTOs.<br>
For thine is the algorithm,<br>
the computation, and the solution,<br>
looping forever and ever.<br>
Return;<br>
  
</p>
